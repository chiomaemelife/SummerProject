					<h1>THE FIRST TIME I VISITED SHOPRITE</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>The first time I went to Shoprite I was about 3 or 4 years old. The first time when I walked into Shoprite I wanted to have everything inside mall.<br><br>
					My mother, the person who took me there wanted to buy snacks from the bakery. When we finished buying all the things we needed at the bakery,  we went to buy drinks were they sell it. So we went went ahead to buy them as I and my brother saw Toys that blew our minds were asking my mother if she can buy it, she said yes, so she bought both drinks and toys for us. So when we finished buying all that we needed at the snack place we went upstairs to watch a movie called king kong after that I and my brother rode on a bus that requires a coin to make it work when we finished we went to buy some cutton candy and some popcorn then we went home.<br><br>
I had a wonderful time at Shoprite then.<br><br>
