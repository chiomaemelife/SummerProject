					<h1>The first Time I Visited Shoprite</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>The day I visited Shoprite for the first time was on a Wednesday on 15th December, 2013. It was a happy day for me because it was my cousin’s birthday and lucky for me she had visited our house three days before her birthday.<br><br>
   That morning I and my parents surprised her with a bucket of water poured all over her body. She was really happy and surprised about what we did. That morning we gave her breakfast in bed and she was happy.<br><br>   
	That afternoon she got to choose whatever channel she wanted to watch that day. We all prayed for her. After some time my mum got her a red gorgeous dress to wear. My mum helped me put on my outing dress and also helped my cousin put on her red dress.<br><br>     
	My dad had gotten the car ready for driving and every other person was ready. On our way to Shoprite I imagined how it was going to look like and we all discussed all about it in the car.<br><br>
	When we got to Shoprite, the place was very big and interesting. They had Merry go round and a Casserole and they also had a cotton candy stand. When my dad packed his car we asked if we could go buy some cotton candy and go on the merry go round and he agreed so we bought it and ate it as we went on the merry go round.<br><br>  
	After the merry go round we went to the Casserole and rode on horses and carriages we had so much fun and the ride was epic. After all the fun, we all made our way to the building.																		As we were about to enter there, the security men and women scanned us and we noticed that as we entered, the door had sensor and I was very surprised because I did not expect it at all. As we were walking we all entered into the main Shoprite and we picked up a basket and we went shopping my parents asked the girl to pick whatever she wanted. When my dad told her that, she was really excited. She first of all went to the snacks department and chose all that she wanted before she started picking any other item. 								After that we went to Max they sold clothes and shoes. There we bought a purple shirt, skinny jean trousers and blue sneakers for her, she was very happy when she saw it. After that we went to Swatch store where they sold swatch and T.M.LEWIN T-shirt. We wanted to buy something but we could not because they were too expensive.  													The next place we went to Games and we also shopped too. We bought some chocolates, biscuits, sweets and other things. In games we saw so many kinds of furniture and they were very outstanding.  		We went to the escalator and stood there while it took us up to the upper floor and we saw the movies. We wanted to watch a movie but we did not have time so we left.<br><br> 						
	As we were moving around we saw a place called Dominos Pizza and we went there and bought pizza and ate together. Inside the place we also saw an ice cream store called pink berry. They sell different flavors of ice cream like apple, yoghurt, chocolate etc.<br><br>    
	We also went to a place where they snapped with camera’s and ha makeup artists too. We took pictures and my mum got her makeup done again.<br><br>   
	We went to the place they sold gym materials and we all talked about because they looked very interesting. We were also tutored on what they were called and how to use them. We wanted to try out some gym materials but it was out of order, so we decided that one day we were going to buy one of the gym materials and so we left that place.<br><br>
